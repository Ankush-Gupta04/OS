It was about to setup Artix linux vm on virtual box

To set up the artix, I followed following step:
https://wiki.artixlinux.org/Main/Installation and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIpZA6z-Ctk
to download config file from host to virtual box, with the help of python server.
then to compile it i used : https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel/Traditional_compilation
for bootloader configuration i used :  grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
